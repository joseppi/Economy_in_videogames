## How could we define Economy in a game?
Economy is a game mechanic that can create a strong joint between all the other mechanics that the game has to offer giving you a strong sense of progress in lots of differents aspects and feeling of acomplishment. It also does motivate you to keep improving and it's a really powerful mechanic that lets you have a set of tools that will improve the player's experience.

## Sense of progress
So, the main concern is, how can we archive that sense of progress in which the player will be hooked to our game for a while. First, we need to separate both RTS and RPG games, since their need different kinds of economies. 

### RPG
The progress of the economy is one of the strongest bases of the RPGs in general. Some of them even go one step further and make the entire game revolve in their economy mechanic such as EVE or Tibia.
